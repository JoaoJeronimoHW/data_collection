Data collection under the project "The secret garden of politics - candidates to parliament 1975-2019" https://www.ics.ulisboa.pt/projeto/o-jardim-secreto-da-politica
The two files comprise my web scrapers for two types of data sources - .json and .html - written in Python 3.8.20. 
The loops are scraping variables NAME, PARTY, DISTRICT and were run for each electoral year. A more efficient scraper might loop over the URLs so as to gather information for every available year, which is something I wasn't able to implement back when I was working on this project.
